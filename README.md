# Retail Sales & Profitability Dashboard  

## Executive Summary  
This project presents a professional Excel-based dashboard that analyzes retail sales and profitability across multiple dimensions. Using Power Query for cleaning, Pivot Tables and Power Pivot (DAX) for modeling, and dynamic Excel visuals, the dashboard enables business stakeholders to quickly monitor performance, identify trends, and uncover actionable insights.  

## Business Problem  
Retail businesses often struggle to balance sales growth with profitability. Discounts, regional performance differences, and product mix can create gaps between revenue and profit. The objective of this project was to build an interactive dashboard that highlights sales trends, profit margins, and regional differences to guide better decision-making.  

## Methodology  
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**: Power Query used to clean and transform raw sales data.  
- **Data Modeling**: Relationships and calculated measures created using Power Pivot and DAX.  
- **Exploration**: Performed analysis across categories, regions, discount bins, and time trends.  
- **Dashboard Design**: Interactive Excel dashboard with slicers, KPIs, and visualizations for storytelling.  

## Skills Demonstrated  
- Data cleaning with **Power Query**  
- Data modeling with **Power Pivot & DAX**  
- Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts  
- Dashboard design and storytelling in Excel  
- Business analysis and insight generation  

## Results & Business Recommendations  

### Key Insights  
1. **Technology leads in sales performance**  
   - Technology consistently outperforms Furniture and Office Supplies.  
   - Recommendation: Focus on Technology product line promotions and inventory optimization.  

2. **High discounts reduce profitability**  
   - Sales volume is high with **0â€“10% discounts**, but profits sharply decline as discounts increase.  
   - Recommendation: Limit excessive discounting and design smarter discount strategies.  

3. **Regional sales are uneven**  
   - The **West and East regions** generate the highest sales and profits, while Central and South underperform.  
   - Recommendation: Prioritize resources and marketing campaigns in high-performing regions, while reviewing strategies for weaker ones.  

## Next Steps  
- Add a **Profit Margin % trend line** to monitor profitability shifts over time.  
- Introduce additional slicers (e.g., region, category, segment) for deeper interactivity.  
- Expand analysis to include **Return Rate % by category or region** to reduce losses.  
- Automate monthly data refresh through Power Query for scalability.
